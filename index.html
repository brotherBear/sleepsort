<h2>About the Sleepsort algorithm</h2>
<p>I was made aware of this funny little creature back in September
	2011, when Kevlin Henney tweeted about it. It was originally posted to
	a forum on 4chan, as a bash shell script.</p>
<p>The original script took a list of integer arguments and spawned
	a process for each of them that slept for the specified number of
	seconds. On waking up, the process would then push its number onto the
	output, thus achieving a sorted result.
