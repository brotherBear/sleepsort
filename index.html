<h2>About the Sleepsort algorithm</h2>
<p>I was made aware of this funny little creature back in September
	2011, when Kevlin Henney tweeted about it. It was originally posted to
	a forum on 4chan, as a bash shell script.</p>
<p>The original script took a list of integer arguments and spawned
	a process for each of them that slept for the specified number of
	seconds. On waking up, the process would then push its number onto the
	output, thus achieving a sorted result.
<p>Here follows the original script:
<pre>
 #!/bin/bash
 function f() {
     sleep "$1"
     echo "$1"
 }
 while [ -n "$1" ]
 do
     f "$1" &
     shift
 done
 wait
 
 example usage:
 ./sleepsort.bash 5 3 6 3 6 3 1 4 7
  </pre>
